			<p>The core functionalities of the app are almost evident. However, the following parts of its behaviour need some explication:</p>
			<h3>Modification of the file system</h3>
			<p>Slide your finger on a file or directory. An 'action sheet' will appear. Here, you'll be able to do the most important modifications: copy, cut, delete etc.</p>
			<p>If you touch the 'accessory button' located on the right side, you'll be presented a details page, where you can modify some properties of the file or directory, or you can compress it (in addition, you can add images and videos to the camera roll and songs to iPod). When you've finished, touch either 'Done' if you want to apply the changes, or 'Close' if not.</p>
			<h3>Image manipulation</h3>
			<p>While viewing an image, push the action button located in the top right corner. You can choose 'Image effects' and apply them to the image. If you want to save the changes, select 'save image' and proceed.</p>
			<h3>Adding music to the iPod library</h3>
			<p>Warning: this funtionality is experimental. After you've added a song to iPod, the iPod app won't be able to see your music library. Don't worry: MyFile (MyPod) still can, and after a sync with iTunes or any application using libgpod everything should be fine again. Before you would be able to add songs, you'll have to generate a HashInfo file from your device's UDID by visiting this site: http://ihash.marcansoft.com/ and putting the resulting HashInfo file to /var/mobile/Media/iTunes_Control/Device on your iPhone. After that you'll have to sync with iTunes or any app using libgpod.</p>
			<h3>Installing packages</h3>
			<p>MyFile can install DEB and IPA packages. For the later, it uses Installous' 'installApp' script (located in /usr/libexec/installipa).</p>
